# Portfolio

Hello !, I'm  **Léo Lassarade**, AI and machine learning student at IT-högskolan - *AI2021*

No surprise, here is **Python** all around. :snake::snake:

As a student, the most representative cornerstones of my programming journey are **labs**. At ITHS, labs allows us to answer problematics by coding from scratch. They are a mixture of comprehensive Jupyter notebook and python scripts designed to solve a specific set of requisites. This portfolio is for now sort of a list of Labs!

Here they are in chronological order:

## Python-programmering

Wrap up of the python course with an **OOP** knolwedge-check:

## Machine Learning

Data analysis and training of different models with two different purposes:
- Recommender system
- Disease prediction

## Deep learning

 :new: The freshest knowledge !
Picture classification with preliminary EDA, using data-augmentation, CNN model-training, and Xception transfer-learning
