# Portfolio

Hello ! I'm  **Léo Lassarade**,  
Just graduated as AI and machine learning developper at IT-högskolan developper (YH) - *AI2021*

## Currently cooking :shallow_pan_of_food: :
:snake: **Python** all around. :snake:

My professional experience as a developper is deeply rooted in **Data Science.**
Although, my current public projects are revolving around **Data Engeneering** and cloud (**Azure**). No intresting homemade Data Science projects without, I guess.

Currently, i'm porting my examination work to Azure. It's about giving a structure for a Machine Learning model I have developped to do inference on live-streamed data.

I'm commited to a maritime intelligence platform project. Repos are private, but it's Azure functions in the making (more :snake:).

## As a student:
The most representative cornerstones of my programming eduication were **labs**. At ITHS, labs allows us to answer problematics by coding from scratch. They are a mixture of comprehensive Jupyter notebook and python scripts designed to solve a specific set of requisites. 

Here they are in chronological order:

### Python-programmering

Wrap up of the python course with an **OOP** knolwedge-check:

### Databehandling

A data exploration for summarizing acquired skills on pandas, matplotib, seaborn , numpy.

### Machine Learning

Data analysis and training of different models with two different purposes:
- Recommender system
- Disease prediction

### Deep learning

 :new: The freshest knowledge !
Picture classification with preliminary EDA, using data-augmentation, CNN model-training, and Xception transfer-learning
